The Program looks to connect to MS Access, go through each sheet/table in the database and extract all the needed information then congregate them into a single sheet/table. This is currently being done by reading query results and writing them on to a text file to be re-read into the new/receiving databse.

Built with Golang, SQL, MS Access

**accessHelper and excelHelper packages are in access repo**
